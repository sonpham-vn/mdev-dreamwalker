# Building the UnrealGeometryEncoder Library

The UnrealGeometryEncoder is loaded by PRT at runtime and implements predefined methods which are called by PRT and are used to encode generated geometry into a format specific for Unreal. The UnrealGeometryEncoder calls a callback interface defined in `IUnrealCallbacks.h` to pass the encoded data to the consumer (the Vitruvio plugin).

To build the UnrealGeometryEncoder follow these steps.

## Prerequisites
- To build the UnrealGeometryEncoder library you will need a source build of Unreal (as an Unreal `TargetType.Program` build is not possible with a prebuilt Unreal). To setup an Unreal Source build follow the steps described here https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine#getting-up-and-running
- Optionally a Python 3.8 installation (for easier setup)

## Windows Build Setup
1. Open a Command Prompt with administrator permissions (important as otherwise creating symlinks will not work)
2. Go to the "Extras" folder of the Vitruvio Plugin (`cd "C:/dev/git/vitruvio/VitruvioHost/Plugins/Vitruvio/Extras"`)
3. Run the setup.py (`python setup.py`). This will setup a symlink of the UnrealGeometryEncoder source into the `VitruvioHost/Source` folder
4. In the Windows Explorer navigate to the VitruvioHost root folder and run "Generate Visual Studio Project files" from the VitruvioHost.uproject context menu (this might take a while if PRT needs to be downloaded)
5. Open the Project in Visual Studio
6. Build the UnrealGeometryEncoder Project found in the "Programs" directory. Building it will automatically update the UnrealGeometryEncoderLib in the ThirdParty folder of PRT with the latest include and library files as a post-build step
